     * This does "Difference of Gaussian" detection in a grid pattern to try to get good features.
     * We then pick the top features in each grid, and return the top features collected over the entire image.
     * This class hasn't been tested that much, as we normally use the Grider_FAST class instead.

     * @par Improve and Test This!
     *      If you are interested in using this grider, then please give it a try and test if for us.
     *      Please open a pull request with any impromements, or an issue if you have had any success.
     *      We still recommend the Grider_FAST class since that is what we normally use.
